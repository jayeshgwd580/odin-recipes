    <h3>Description:-</h3>
    <p>Chakli It is a deep fried savory snack in the shape of spiral with small spikes.</p>
        <br><br>
    <h3>Ingredients of Chakali:-</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour - Rice flour and besan (gram flour or chickpea flour)</li>
        <li>Spices - red chili powder, coriander powder, turmeric, hing (asafoetida), and salt.</li>
        <li>Seeds - carom seeds (ajwain), cumin seeds (zeera), and white sesame seeds (til)</li>
        <li>Fat - Oil, ghee, or butter. This helps make the chakli crispy. Always add hot. I've used ghee.</li>
        <li>Oil - for frying. I prefer using peanut oil.</li>
        <li>Water - Use hot water for making the dough.</li>
        <li>Chakli press - This is the tool we will use to make/shape the chaklis. I got mine from India but linking a similar kind like mine Brass chakli press or a stainless steel chakli press.</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Directions:-</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> In a large mixing bowl, sift the rice flour and gram flour.</li>
        <li>To it, add the spices (red chili powder, coriander powder, turmeric, hing (asafoetida), and salt) and seeds (carom seeds (ajwain), cumin seeds (zeera), and white sesame seeds (til)). Mix with a spoon (or spatula) to combine.</li>
        <li>Heat ghee (or oil) on stove top or microwave and add to this dry mix.</li>

        <li>Incorporate the ghee(oil) into the flour using hands or spoon. It will form a crumbly texture and the color will change to orangish-yellow.</li>
        <li>Boil some water and use this hot water, some at a time knead a soft pliable dough. Used approximately half cup hot water.</li>
        <li>Rest for 5-10 mins by covering with a wet cloth. Donâ€™t rest for too long as it may get dry. </li>
        <li>Give the rested dough a quick knead one more time and then divide into two equal portions (portions can vary depending on the size of your chakli maker)</li>
        <li> Take the chakli press and add the star disk to it so it's flat and seals the bottom.</li>
        <li>Add one portion of the dough, press so it fits inside the tube. Close and tightly secure the lid/handle of the chakli maker.</li>
        <li>Line a plate or baking sheet with parchment paper or cut individual parchment paper squares for each chakali. This makes transferring to oil easy.</li>
        <li> Press the chakli press to squeeze out the dough and then move in a circular motion to make spirals.</li>
        <li>Make about 4-5 spirals, close to each other for each chakli.</li>
        <li>Break the dough and seal the outside and inside edge (i.e start and end) to prevent them from opening while frying.</li>
        <li>Continue pressing the remaining chakalis in a similar manner. Keep them covered with a wet cloth to prevent drying. Makes 7-8 chaklis of 4-5 round each with one portion.</li>
    </ol>
    <br><br>
    <h3>TO FRY:-</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a frying pan and test the temperature by adding a small piece of the dough. It should rise up gradually in a few seconds.</li>
        <li>If it rises too fast then the oil is very hot and if it doesn't then the oil needs to heat up more.</li>
        <li>Line a baking tray or plate with paper towel and keep it ready.</li>

        <li>Add 1-2 pieces of chakali or as much the pan can hold without over crowding.</li>
        <li>Fry on medium-low heat until golden.</li>
        <li>Drain and then transfer on an on lined plate to drain excess oil. Keep frying the remaining chaklis in a similar manner.</li>
        <li>Crispy and crunchy chaklis are ready!!</li>
    </ol>
