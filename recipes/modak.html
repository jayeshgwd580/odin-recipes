    <h3>Description:-</h3>
    <p>Modak is Bhagwan Ganesha’s favorite sweet and made in many Hindu homes during the first day of Ganesh Chaturthi
        Festival. The most popular variety of modak that is made is Ukadiche modak (steamed modak) which is from the
        Maharashtrian Cuisine. In this post I am sharing two ways of making modak recipe – with mould and without the
